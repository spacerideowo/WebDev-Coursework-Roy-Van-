# Reflection on HTML & CSS Layout Lessons

Through this series of lessons, I have learned how to build and style web pages using HTML and CSS. Starting with basic structure elements like `<div>` and class attributes, I gradually moved into more advanced concepts like the box model, display properties, and position strategies.

By the time I reached the responsive and adaptive design challenges, I was able to apply what I had learned to create layouts that adjust to different screen sizes. I learned that responsive design uses flexible units and media queries to create fluid layouts, while adaptive design switches between fixed layouts for different devices.

Working on files like `5_Position.html`, `6_Display_Properties.html`, and `9_Responsive_Design.html` helped me understand the difference between document flow and fixed positioning. The final challenge with adaptive design allowed me to experiment with breakpoints and custom layouts.

Overall, I feel much more confident in creating websites that are both functional and user-friendly across devices. I now understand how layout, display, and responsiveness work together to create modern, professional web designs.
