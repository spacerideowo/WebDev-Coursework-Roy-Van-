# Reflection

In this unit, I learned how CSS can completely change the way a website looks and feels. I started by exploring basic properties like text size, font, and color, and then moved on to using different types of CSS: inline, internal, and external. I found it especially useful to learn how to use internal and external CSS for cleaner, more organized code. The code challenges helped me apply what I learned and made the concepts stick. Now, I feel more confident in my ability to style web pages and Iâ€™m excited to explore more advanced topics like layout and responsive design in the future.
