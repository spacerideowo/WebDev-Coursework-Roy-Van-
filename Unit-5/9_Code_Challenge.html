        <p>Hi, my name is Shannon. I live in California, the Bay Area to be exact. If I had to choose a person to meet, I'd choose Ursula Burns. She was the first Black woman to become the CEO of a Fortune 500 company — Xerox! Isn’t that inspiring? I love all things tech. I plan to take every computer science course offered at school! Tech is amazing because it lets us create. My dream is to build something that changes the world..</p>
        <h2>Current Project</h2> 
        <p>Right now, I'm working with my best friends on a website that's a mix of Instagram and Spotify. Pretty cool, right? It's still a work in progress, but if we finish it, I think a lot of people will use it! <br>Fun Fact: My favorite color is purple</p>
