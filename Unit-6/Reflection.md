# Reflection on HTML Practice

In this project, I worked on different HTML files to practice links, images, icons, and styling. Each file helped me understand a new concept and apply it step by step.

## Files I worked on:
- Relative vs absolute links
- Opening links in new tabs
- Styling links with CSS
- Making images clickable
- Adding favicons
- Styling images and span text

I learned how to connect pages, improve readability, and make websites more interactive. I also practiced using span tags to style specific words without breaking the layout.

Overall, this experience helped me build more confidence in basic HTML and CSS. I'm now better prepared to design websites and listen to feedback from clients to make improvements.
