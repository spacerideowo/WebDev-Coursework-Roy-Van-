# Reflection: History and Current Day Web Design

Looking back on this course, I realize how far I've come as a beginning web designer. At the start, I learned how the Internet and the World Wide Web were created and how everything — servers, browsers, websites — is part of a global system that connects people for learning, work, business, and entertainment.

I explored some of my favorite websites and got to "peek under the hood" using developer tools. That was the first time I really understood that websites are built with code.

I started with **HTML**, writing simple pages with titles, headings, and paragraphs. Then, I added **CSS** to style the pages — changing colors, fonts, and layout to make the site more readable and attractive. After that, I learned **JavaScript** to make my pages interactive, like adding buttons and alert messages.

But this course wasn’t just about code. I also learned to think like a designer through the **Design Thinking Process**. I learned to consider the needs of users and get feedback to improve my website. I discovered how important **accessibility** is, especially for people with visual or learning challenges, and I made sure to add features like alt text to help everyone use my site.

I also explored the **UN Global Goals** and thought about how websites can raise awareness and help solve real-world problems. That made me realize that web design isn’t just about looks — it can make a real difference.

Now, I know the basics of building websites that work, look good, and are easy to use. I’ve learned about best practices like keeping things simple, consistent, and accessible. I feel ready to keep learning and building.

In the future, I’m interested in exploring more advanced tools like JavaScript frameworks, UX/UI design, or even full-stack development. I might try building a personal website or portfolio next, or look for opportunities like internships or certifications. No matter what path I take, I’m excited to keep creating and improving as a web designer.

**This course gave me a strong foundation — now I’m ready to build on it.**
