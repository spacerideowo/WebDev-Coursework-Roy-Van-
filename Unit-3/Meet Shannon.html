    <h1> Meet Shannon</h1>

    <p><strong>Hi, my name is Shannon.</strong> I live in <em>California</em>, the Bay Area to be exact.</p>

    <p>If I had to choose a person to meet, I'd choose <mark>Ursula Burns</mark>. She was the first Black woman to become the CEO of a Fortune 500 company — <b>Xerox</b>! Isn’t that inspiring?</p>

    <p>I <i>love</i> all things tech. I plan to take every <u>computer science</u> course offered at school!</p>

    <p>Tech is amazing because it lets us <strong>create</strong>. My dream is to build something that <em>changes the world</em>.</p>

    <h2> Current Project</h2>

    <p>It's still a work in progress, but if we finish it, I think a lot of people will use it!</p>

    <p><small>Fun Fact: My favorite color is <mark>purple</mark> </small></p>
