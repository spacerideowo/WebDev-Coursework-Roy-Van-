# Reflection on Unit 9: Introduction to JavaScript

In Unit 9, I learned how JavaScript can bring interactivity to websites. At first, I didn’t know what JavaScript really did, but now I understand how important it is for making web pages respond to users.

In Lesson 1, I learned what JavaScript is and why it’s used. Lesson 2 taught me how to create simple input and output using functions and buttons. I found it fun to make a pop-up appear when a button is clicked. The Code Challenge helped me practice by asking the user for input and showing output.

In Lesson 3, I learned how JavaScript can change the content of a page using `innerHTML`, and I practiced that by making a sentence change when I clicked a button. It was very cool to see how one small line of code could change the whole webpage experience.

Overall, this unit helped me feel more confident using JavaScript. I’m excited to keep learning and to build more interactive and dynamic websites in the future.
