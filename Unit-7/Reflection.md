# Reflection on Unit 7: Apply Design Thinking

In Unit 7, I learned how to use the Design Thinking process to create a meaningful website for a real community need. This unit helped me connect problem-solving with real people’s experiences.

## Empathize
I started by talking to a community member to understand their needs. By listening carefully, I realized that many people in the neighborhood feel disconnected and don’t know about upcoming events.

## Define
Based on my notes, I created the define statement:  
**The community needs a way to stay informed about local events in order to feel more connected and involved.**

## Ideate
I brainstormed ideas for how a community website could solve this problem. Some ideas included adding a calendar, event photos, and a contact form. I also thought about using clear fonts and simple layout to make it easier to use.

## Prototype
Using HTML and CSS, I created the first version of the website. It includes a welcome message, navigation bar, and a short introduction to the community. I focused on a clean design that’s easy to read and update.

Overall, this unit showed me how web design is not just about coding — it's about understanding people and building something useful.
