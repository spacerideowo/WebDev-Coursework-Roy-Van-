# What I Learned from HTML Basics  

## Main Takeaways  

1. **Text Formatting**  
   - Learned how to make text bold (difference between `<b>` and `<strong>`, accessibility)  
   - Can use italics (`<i>` and `<em>`), strikethrough (`<del>`), and underline (`<ins>`)  
   - Know how to make small text (`<small>`) and highlighted text (`<mark>`)  

2. **Webpage Structure**  
   - Use `<br>` for line breaks and `<hr>` for horizontal lines  
   - Learned to write comments (`<!-- notes -->`) to explain my code or store codes that I don't want to run

3. **File Management**  
   - Saved each exercise in separate files and number them in order to stay organized  

## Potential Improvements
- **Build a complete webpage**: Next time, combine these small exercises into one personal webpage  
- **Learn CSS earlier**: My pages look plain now, adding colors and layouts would make them better  
- **Save more exercises while learning**: Should write down problems and solutions I discover  

> Summary: I've learned HTML basics. Next step - try making more practical webpages!
