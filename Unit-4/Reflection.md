# What I Learned About HTML Styling

## Main Takeaways  

1. **Tooltips & Language Attributes**  
   - Created interactive tooltips that appear when hovering  
   - Learned to specify language using `lang` attribute  

2. **Different List Types**  
   - Made ordered lists with numbers/letters (`<ol>`)  
   - Created unordered bullet lists (`<ul>`)  
   - Used description lists (`<dl>`) for terms and definitions  
   - Nested lists inside each other  

3. **Working with Images**  
   - Inserted images into webpages  
   - Learned about important image attributes

## What I Can Improve  
- **Combine elements**: Try using lists and images together in one page  
- **More attributes**: Explore additional attributes for each element   

> Summary: I've gained solid skills in HTML lists, images and tooltips. Next I'll practice combining these elements in complete webpages!
