# Reflection on Unit 10: Feedback and Iteration

In Unit 10, I learned how to bring together HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a complete, functional, and well-organized website. I started by combining what I had learned in earlier units to structure and style a website, then added JavaScript to make it interactive.

In Lesson 2, I learned how to create a navigation bar and apply it consistently across different pages. I now understand how to use `<nav>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` to make a responsive navigation menu, and how media queries can adapt the layout for different screen sizes. This made my website more user-friendly and professional-looking.

Lesson 3 introduced me to the design principles behind good web development. I learned about visual hierarchy, consistency, navigability, and how to use color and typography effectively. These principles helped me think like a designer, not just a coder. I now consider how users will feel and interact with my website, not just how it looks.

This unit helped me see how all the pieces of web development come together. I'm proud of how far I've come and more confident about creating websites that are both functional and visually strong.
